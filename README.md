# githubStatusBoard

I'm a visual person, and I like to be able to quickly see what I have most recently worked on (and what hasn't been touched in a while).

I made a simple status board to show me green, yellow, and red repositories based on the last commit date.

You can use it yourself by replacing the github user with your own.<br>
You can also change how long it takes for items to turn green to red by changing TURNS_RED_DAYS and TURNS_YELLOW_DAYS.
